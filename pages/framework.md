# BridgeDb Framework

The [BridgeDb Framework](https://github.com/bridgedb/BridgeDb)
consists out of a [Java Library](https://github.com/bridgedb/BridgeDb/releases)
and an [Application Programming Interface](webservice.md) (API).

## Java Library

The Java library contains a number of modules to support the basic, intermediate,
and extended functionality. All code is hosted on GitHub, both for the
[Framework](https://github.com/bridgedb/BridgeDb) itself
and [Applications](https://github.com/bridgedb)
of BridgeDb. Below is an overview of modules and their dependencies (ob == org.bridgedb):
